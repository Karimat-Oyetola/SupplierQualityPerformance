## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis was obtained during my search for comprehensive and rich data to refine my skills in data analysis. It contains detailed records from multiple plants and includes key information such as:

- Vendor Details: Names and associated metrics for suppliers.
- Plant Locations: Locations where materials were received and utilized.
- Categories and Types of Materials: Detailed classifications of raw materials and other components.
- Types and Impacts of Defects: Specific defect classifications, including their operational impacts.
- Total Defect Quantities: The number of defective units recorded for each combination of vendor, plant, and material.
- Downtime Minutes: Operational delays caused by defective materials.
  
This dataset spans two years of operations, offering a comprehensive view of supplier performance and enabling meaningful insights into the impact of defects on production efficiency.

## Data Normalization & Modeling
The dataset required preprocessing to ensure accuracy and consistency.
###### Key steps included:
- Handled missing values: Ensured no critical data points were missing, addressing gaps in defect quantities or downtime minutes.
- Standardized Data Formats: Unified inconsistent date formats and standardized categorical values for vendors, plants, and material types.
- Filtered Relevant Data: Removed outliers and irrelevant entries (e.g. entries with zero defect quantities or downtime).

###### Modeling:
I created primary keys for dimension tables, such as vendors, plants, and material types, to uniquely identify records and enable seamless integration with the fact table. 
This step ensured a robust data model, allowing accurate connections between dimensional and transactional data, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and reliability of the analysis.
These steps prepared the data for meaningful analysis, ensuring all insights were derived from high-quality, reliable data.

The model is a star schema. The dimension table are all joined to the fact table with one-to-many relationship.

## Data Analysis
In this project, I used Power BI to perform an in-depth analysis of supplier performance and its impact on operational efficiency. Here's a breakdown of some steps I took and the measures I created using DAX to uncover valuable insights:
   - Date Table Creation
     - The first step was to create a Date Table to enable time-based analysis. This table provided a foundation for filtering data by months, years, and custom time frames, making it easier to track trends and 
     compare performance across periods.
     
           Date = ADDCOLUMNS(
                              CALENDARAUTO(),
                              "Year", YEAR([Date]),
                              "Quarter", QUARTER([Date]),
                              "Month", MONTH([Date]),
                              "Month Name", FORMAT([Date], "mmmm"),
                              "Month Name Short", FORMAT([Date], "mmm"),
                              "Day", DAY([Date]),
                              "Day of the Week", WEEKDAY([Date]),
                              "Day of Week Name", FORMAT([Date], "dddd"),
                              "Week of Year", WEEKNUM([Date]),
                              "Is Weekend", IF(WEEKDAY([Date]) IN {1, 7}, TRUE, FALSE)
            )

  - Measures
    - I developed base measures to calculate essential metrics such as total downtime, defect quantities, and costs. These measures allowed me to identify:
      -Vendors supplying materials causing the highest downtime.
     
          1. Total Downtime Hours = [Total Downtime Minutes]/60
      
          2. Total Downtime Minutes = SUM('Supplier Fact'[Total Downtime Minutes])
      
          3. Total Downtime Hours PM = CALCULATE([Total Downtime Hours],PARALLELPERIOD('Date'[Date], -1,MONTH))
      
          4. Total Downtime Hours SPLY = CALCULATE([Total Downtime Hours],SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))
      
    - Vendors with the most defects.
              
           1. Total Downtime Cost PM = CALCULATE('Downtime Cost'[Downtime Cost/Hr], PARALLELPERIOD('Date'[Date],-1,MONTH))

           2. YOYGrowthDefectQuantity = 
                DIVIDE(
                    [Total Defect Qty] - [Defect Qty SPLY],
                    [Defect Qty SPLY]
                )

           3. MOM Defect Quantity Trend Icon = 
                    VAR PositiveIcon = UNICHAR(9650)
                      VAR NegativeIcon = UNICHAR(9650)
                        VAR Choice = IF([MOMGrowthDefectQuantity]> 0, PositiveIcon, NegativeIcon)
                          VAR Display = Choice & " " & FORMAT ([MOMGrowthDefectQuantity], "0.00%")
                            RETURN Display
        
     - Risk categories for vendors based on their performance (high, medium, low).
      
           1. Risk Category = 
                  VAR CurrentVendor = SELECTEDVALUE(Vendor[Vendor])
                    VAR TotalDowntimeHours = CALCULATE([Total Downtime Hours], FILTER(Vendor, Vendor[Vendor] = CurrentVendor))
                      RETURN IF([Total Downtime Hours] > 800, "High Risk" ,  IF([Total Downtime Hours] <= 800 && [Total Downtime Hours] >= 400, "Medium Risk", "Low Risk"))
              
   - Yearly Comparison
      - To track progress, I created measures to compare performance:

     - Last Year vs. This Year: Evaluated how defects and downtime changed over the years.

     - Total Defect Last Month: Focused on recent performance to identify emerging issues.
       
             TotaL Defect Qty PM = CALCULATE([Total Defect Qty],PARALLELPERIOD('Date'[Date],-1, MONTH))
       
     - Total Defect Previous Year: Helped establish baselines for improvement tracking.
       
             Defect Qty SPLY = CALCULATE([Total Defect Qty],SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))
       
- Trends Analysis
  - I built measures to visualize trends over time:
     - Defect Trend: Displayed how defect quantities changed month-to-month.
      
            MOM Defect Quantity Trend Icon = 
                VAR PositiveIcon = UNICHAR(9650)
                  VAR NegativeIcon = UNICHAR(9650)
                    VAR Choice = IF([MOMGrowthDefectQuantity]> 0, PositiveIcon, NegativeIcon)
                      VAR Display = Choice & " " & FORMAT ([MOMGrowthDefectQuantity], "0.00%")
                        RETURN Display
    
     - Downtime Trend: Highlighted patterns in downtime hours, helping pinpoint seasonal or recurring issues.
      
              YOY Downtime Hour Trend Icon = 
                VAR PositiveIcon = UNICHAR(9650)
                  VAR NegativeIcon = UNICHAR(9650)
                    VAR Choice = IF([YOYGrowthDowntimeHours]> 0, PositiveIcon, NegativeIcon)
                      VAR Display = Choice & " " & FORMAT ([YOYGrowthDowntimeHours], "0.00%")
                        RETURN Display

#### 3. Is there a particular combination of material and vendor that perform poorly?

![](Material_Defect.png) 

#### **Material-Vendor Combinations Performing Poorly**

1. Raw Materials:
   - Contributed to the highest downtime (66K hours) and defect quantity (0.77 billion), indicating consistent issues across multiple vendors.
   - Vendors such as **Edgeblab** and **Yombu** are likely key contributors, as they are linked to high downtime and defects in other areas.

2. Corrugates:
   - Downtime 51K hours and defect quantity 0.62 billion were also significant, often linked to vendors like **Zooveo**, which show consistent performance issues.

Key Combinations:
   - Raw Materials and Edgeblab are a problematic combination, causing high defect quantities and downtime.
   - Corrugate and Zooveo also stand out as a poorly performing combination, with significant operational impact.

This combination of materials and vendors points to systemic issues with specific supply chains, particularly for raw materials and corrugates. Addressing these problems with high-risk vendors will be critical to reducing defects and downtime.
